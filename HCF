Example: Find the GCF of 12 and 8.

Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12

Factors of 8: 1, 2, 4, 8

Common Factors: 1, 2, 4

Greatest Common Factor: 4

Using Java for loop

In the following program, we have initialized two numbers a=12 and b=8. After that, we have used a for loop that runs from 1 to the smallest of both numbers. It executes until the condition i <= a && i <= b returns true. Inside the for loop, we have also used if statement that tests the condition (a%i==0 && b%i==0) and returns true if both conditions are satisfied. At last, we have store the value of i in the variable gcd and print the same gcd variable.

EXAMPLE:

class Gcd
{
    public static void main (String args[])
    {
       int a = 12;
       int b = 8;
       int c=( a>b)?a:b;
       int GCD= 0;
       for( int i=2;i<=b;i++)
        {
           if(a%i==0 && b%i==0)
            {
               GCD=i;
                
             }
       }

          System.out.println(GCD);
   }
} 

OUTPUT:

4

For finding three numbers:

    class Hcf
{
  public static void main(String args[])
    { 
        int hcf=0;
        int a=12;
        int b=20;
        int c=24;

        for(int i=1;i<=a || i<=b || i<=c;i++)
           {
                 
                if(a%i==0 && b%i==0 && c%i==0)
                hcf=i;
            }
              System.out.println(hcf);
      }
    }
}
OUTPUT:
4
